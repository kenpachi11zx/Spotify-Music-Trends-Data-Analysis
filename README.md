```

Then run each script individually:

```bash
python 1_top_songs_by_popularity.py
python 2_top_artists_by_avg_popularity.py
python 3_top_genres.py
python 4_language_distribution.py
python 5_most_streamed_songs.py
```

## Notes

- If any column is missing (like `streams` or `language`), the script will notify you.
- Make sure column names in the dataset match those used in scripts.
